## üí¨ Usage Examples

### Starting a Conversation

1. Run the application
2. Select "Start Philosopher Dialogue"
3. Choose a philosopher from the list
4. Begin your philosophical discussion!

Example conversation with Socrates:
```
Socrates: Greetings, my friend! I am Socrates of Athens. I know nothing, yet I am eager to learn through our dialogue. What questions trouble your mind today?

You: What is the meaning of life?

Socrates: Ah, my dear friend, you ask perhaps the most important question of all! But tell me, before we can discover what life means, must we not first examine what we mean by "meaning" itself? And what do you suppose makes a life worth living? Is it pleasure, as some claim, or virtue, or perhaps something else entirely?
```

### Creating a Debate

1. Select "Create Philosophical Debate"
2. Enter your debate topic (e.g., "Is free will an illusion?")
3. Select 2-5 philosophers to participate
4. Watch as they engage in authentic philosophical discourse!

## üîß Development

### Adding New Philosophers

1. Create a new philosopher class inheriting from `Philosopher`
2. Implement the required abstract methods
3. Add the philosopher to the `PhilosopherFactory`
4. Update the `PhilosopherType` enum

Example:
```python
class NewPhilosopher(Philosopher):
    def __init__(self):
        profile = PhilosopherProfile(
            name="New Philosopher",
            era="Time Period",
            nationality="Nationality",
            key_concepts=["Concept 1", "Concept 2"],
            famous_works=["Work 1", "Work 2"],
            philosophical_school="School",
            brief_description="Description"
        )
        super().__init__(profile)
    
    def _define_conversation_style(self) -> str:
        return "Conversation style description"
    
    def _define_core_beliefs(self) -> List[str]:
        return ["Belief 1", "Belief 2"]
    
    def _define_response_patterns(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
        return {"topic": "response pattern"}
```

### Testing

Run the application with debug mode enabled:
```bash
DEBUG=True python main.py
```
